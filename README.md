# Project: Connect Four

A project for the Odin Project Ruby Course

### Assignment

Build Connect Four! Just be sure to keep it TDD.

From Wikipedia:

>Connect Four... is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
